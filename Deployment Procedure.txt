Step 1:
Create a repository in GitHub. lets call it otree-project. also create email on render.com.
Commit all your files (meaning upload the project file) i have given u as shown in next step.
Push your project
Step 2:
use any IDE or even command prompt. i have used VSCode
execute these commands while in the otree_project folder (use cd cammand to get there)
the fifth cammand below needs to be have url specific to u

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Render deploy"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/otree-project.git
git push -u origin main

Step 3:
Go to Render Dashboard .
Click New → Database → Postgres.
In Name call it something like otree-db.
After database creation, copy the Internal Database URL it gives you. we will use this later.

Step 4:
New → Web Service.
Connect it to your GitHub repository. select the project u pushed in step 2.

on the left side u will see Environment tab go there and set "Environment Variables" section, add:
DATABASE_URL → the URL you got from the Postgres you created (remember i said u to copy)
OTREE_ADMIN_PASSWORD → your chosen admin password (important so only u can create room/sessions and export data, not anyone else)
OTREE_AUTH_LEVEL → STUDY
click save and deploy

Step 5:
go to logs u will see that Render will:
Install dependencies
Start your app using the Procfile command (i have already created web: otree prodserver 0.0.0.0:$PORT) it will do automatically
It will also give you a domain like:

https://yourappname.onrender.com

Step 6:
Now once u get this domain url, copy it and paste it (overwrite the link) in settings.py that is in otree_project folder where it says ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourappname.onrender.com']

step 7:
deployment will again happen.

Step 8:
your web application is live now. go to the domain link provided (https://otree-project.onrender.com)
if will ask for admin login:
username is admin (u can change it in settings.py)
password is the one u set for OTREE_ADMIN_PASSWORD in step 4.

Step 9:
There are two ways u can start the experiment session and room. I think, u should go for rooms. I have already created one u just need to access it.
Go to rooms from the top bar -> click the already created room called Social Investment Experiment Room.

Step 10:
Select number of participants. There u can see it says multiple of 3. It is because we have set it that way. However, room gives u a choice to increase the number of participants but in multiples of the constant number u set in program. Nonetheless group number remains fixed (it is set to 3 for now). If u want to change these settings, u need to update __init__.py file. I have created variables in constant for easy access and change.

Step 11:
Once room is created or even when u havent, u can distribute the url which will make the participants wait if the enter the url. This is another benifit of using rooms. it creates a waiting area before the actual experiment can be started.

https://otree-render-project.onrender.com/room_with_session/social_investment_app

Furthermore there is also hard coded links. u can click show/hide button and u will get urls that u can give to different participants.
this becomes important if u dont trust ur participants because a single participant can open two browsers to play for two players at the same time.

for example it will look something like this:
P1 https://otree-project.onrender.com/InitializeParticipant/qjjfduxb
P2 https://otree-project.onrender.com/InitializeParticipant/9cma2ilt

Step 12:
After experiment ends u can go to data and click CSV in Custom exports. the downloaded file will have the results that looks like this:

EXPERIMENT SETTINGS (Session: zh7dylml)					
PLAYERS_PER_GROUP	3				
NUM_GROUPS	3				
NUM_ROUNDS	3				
CORRECT_CHOICE_REWARD	10				
INCORRECT_CHOICE_PENALTY	0				
TRANSACTION_COST	0				
ADVISOR_CORRECTION_THRESHOLD_PERCENT	70				
					
ID	participant_code	num_correct	num_incorrect	times_followed_adviser	total_payoff
P1	7ddy6t8k	0	3	0	0
P2	drphca01	0	3	0	0
