    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the experiment! Please read these instructions carefully.</p>

    <h2>Experiment Overview</h2>
    <p>You will participate in <strong>{{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds</strong>. In each round:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will be grouped with <strong>{{ C.OTHER_PLAYERS }} other participant(s)</strong>.</li>
        <li>You must choose between two investment options: <strong>Option A</strong> or <strong>Option B</strong>.</li>
        <li>One option will be randomly selected as <strong>successful</strong> for the round <strong>for each
                group</strong>.</li>
        <li>You will receive recommendation from an <strong>Advisor</strong> before making your choice.
            <br>

                <font color="purple">
                    <em>(The Advisor can be correct or incorrect, and you may choose to follow or ignore the
                        advice)</em>
                </font>
            </small>
        </li>
        <li>You will see the selections made by <strong>previous members of your group</strong>, but <strong>not the
                advice
                they</strong> received.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Decision Making</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Decisions are made sequentially, for example:
            <ul>
                <li>Player 1 decides first without seeing any prior selections.</li>
                <li>Player 2 can see Player 1 selection before deciding.</li>
                <li>Player 3 can see Players 1 and Players 2 selections before deciding, and so on...</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Before making your choice, you will receive a suggestion from the Advisor (e.g., Option "A"
            or "B").</li>
        <li>Advisor gives <strong>different suggestions</strong> to different players <strong>even within the same
                group</strong> (e.g., Player 1
            may get suggested "A" while Player 2 can get suggested "B", etc.).</li>
        <li>The suggestion can be correct or incorrect depending on the Advisor's accuracy — you may
            choose to follow or ignore it.</li>
        <li>If you are not the first player in your group, you will also see the choices made by previous
            group members before making your own decision.
        </li>
        <li>You may:
            <ul>
                <li>Follow the suggestion you receive from the Advisor</li>
                <li>Follow choices made by previous group members</li>
                <li>Use your own independent judgment</li>
                <li>Or combine any of these approaches</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Earnings</h2>
    <div class="card bg-light mb-3">
        <div class="card-body">
            <p><strong>✅ Correct choice:</strong> You earn <strong>{{ C.CORRECT_CHOICE_REWARD }}</strong></p>
            {% if C.INCORRECT_CHOICE_PENALTY > 0 %}
            <p><strong>❌ Incorrect choice:</strong> You lose <strong>{{ C.INCORRECT_CHOICE_PENALTY }}</strong></p>
            {% else %}
            <p><strong>❌ Incorrect choice:</strong> No penalty (but you earn <strong>0 points</strong>)</p>
            {% endif %}
            <p><strong>💸 Transaction cost:</strong>
                {% if C.TRANSACTION_COST <= 0 %} There is no transaction fee. {% else %} A fee of <strong>
                    {{C.TRANSACTION_COST }}</strong> will be deducted from your earnings every round.</p>
            {% endif %}
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>After all decisions are made, you will see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which option was successful for the round.</li>
        <li>Whether your selection was correct.</li>
        <li>Whether you followed/aligned with the Advisor's recommendation.</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Your final payment will be the sum of your earnings across all {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.</strong></p>
